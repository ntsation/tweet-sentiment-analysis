# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling with Twitter Data
## Overview
This Python script analyzes sentiment and identifies topics in a dataset of Twitter data related to COVID-19. The script utilizes the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. Additionally, a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the required libraries before running the script. You can use the following command:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn textblob scikit-learn wordcloud tqdm
```
## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure that you have the required dataset (CSV file) in the specified path.
3. Open and run the notebook using Jupyter.
## Notebook Sections
1. Loading and Preprocessing Data
The notebook starts by loading the Twitter data from the specified CSV file using the Pandas library.
Sentiment analysis is performed on each tweet using TextBlob, and the sentiment polarity scores are added to the DataFrame.
2. Topic Modeling with LDA
The notebook defines a function (get_lda_topics) to perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It preprocesses the text, creates a document-term matrix, and fits the LDA model.
3. Visualizing Topics
Functions (plot_lda_topics and plot_wordclouds) are included to visualize the topics generated by the LDA model. This involves displaying the top words for each topic and creating word clouds.
4. Visualizing Sentiment Distribution
The distribution of sentiment polarity scores is visualized using a histogram.
5. Training a Sentiment Classifier
A Naive Bayes classifier is trained to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.
6. Evaluating the Classifier
The notebook evaluates the performance of the sentiment classifier using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
## Results
The notebook generates visualizations to help understand the distribution of sentiment in the Twitter dataset and provides insights into the main topics discussed. The sentiment classifier's performance metrics are also displayed, offering an assessment of its accuracy and effectiveness.

Feel free to customize and extend the notebook based on your specific requirements.
