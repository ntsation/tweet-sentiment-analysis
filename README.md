# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling with Twitter Data

## Overview
This notebook performs **sentiment analysis** and **topic modeling** on a dataset of **COVID-19** related tweets. The script uses the **TextBlob** library for sentiment analysis and the **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** algorithm to uncover latent topics within the tweet text. Additionally, a classifier is trained to categorize tweets into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**.

## Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have installed the necessary libraries. You can install all the dependencies with the following command:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn textblob scikit-learn wordcloud tqdm
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - First, clone this repository to your local environment or Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Obtain the dataset**:
   - Ensure you have the CSV file containing the tweets in the specified path within the notebook. The dataset should include a column with the tweet text.

3. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** and execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Notebook Sections

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The notebook starts by loading the Twitter data from the specified CSV file using the **Pandas** library.
- Sentiment analysis is then performed on each tweet using **TextBlob**, and the sentiment polarity scores are added to the dataframe.

### 2. Topic Modeling with LDA
- Topic modeling is performed using the **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** algorithm, a popular technique for discovering hidden topics in large text datasets.
- The notebook defines the function `get_lda_topics()` to preprocess the text, create a document-term matrix, and fit the LDA model.

### 3. Visualizing Topics
- Functions such as `plot_lda_topics()` and `plot_wordclouds()` are used to visualize the topics generated by the LDA model.
- These visualizations include displaying the most frequent words for each topic and creating **word clouds** to graphically represent the topics.

### 4. Visualizing Sentiment Distribution
- The distribution of sentiment polarity scores is visualized using a **histogram**, giving a clear view of how sentiments are distributed across the tweets.

### 5. Training a Sentiment Classifier
- A **Naive Bayes classifier** is trained to classify tweets into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**.
- The model is trained using the labeled dataset and the sentiment polarity scores extracted earlier.

### 6. Evaluating the Classifier
- The performance of the classifier is evaluated using metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **accuracy**.
- A **confusion matrix** and **classification report** are generated to assess the classifier's effectiveness and identify which sentiment categories were more difficult to classify correctly.

## Results
When running the notebook, you will obtain the following results:

- **Topic Visualizations**: Images displaying the topics generated by the LDA model and the most common words associated with each topic. This helps understand the main issues being discussed in the COVID-19 tweets.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Graphs showing the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, and neutral) in the tweets.
- **Classifier Performance**: Performance metrics such as model accuracy, the confusion matrix, and the classification report, providing detailed insights into the classifier's effectiveness.
